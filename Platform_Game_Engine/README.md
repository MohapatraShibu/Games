# Platform game engine 🕹️
* A classic retro game made using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
* A simple platform game engine, the map is customisable and scriptable. 
* Refer to the comments in the "map" variable for instructions.
* I plan to expand the engine, the ability to use images for tiles and the player is one thing that I have in mind.
